                  As a start to the new landmark year of 2020 and Dubai playing host to the World Expo, we would also like to publicly announce a new scheme for the benefit of the FM community by offering our IOT platform as a service.

                  A Q1 2020 launch of a few newer solutions that are currently under test-phase in our IoT development Lab, is eagerly anticipated by the team. These solutions will specifically address manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality and retail sectors. As an example, manufacturing plants will be able to increase their production efficiency using the equipment effectively, predict and rectify faults before it can cause a delay in production and avoid production of defective products. Predictive analysis, machine learning and AI will be a plugin standard for all the new launches, slated for early 2020.

                  This is a combination of various factors, both internal and external. But, in general, although customers are curious and want to be early adopters of cutting-edge technologies, there is still a fair amount of hesitation. Convincing them could mean change in key processes and more importantly, expectations are high due to not having had the best results while previously using legacy technology not living up to that high expectation. Our approach is to let our work speak for itself and see an increasing trend in visits (at our 24x7 Command and Control Centre) from and POCs for large and reputed players from the facilities management and building owners community. Feedback is positive and they are enthusiastic about the potential and adoption of Building Talkz, as an IOT platform of choice. We are here to help in streamlining operations and create value to end users, at the same time, trimming costs and create overall efficiency from a day-to-day perspective.
